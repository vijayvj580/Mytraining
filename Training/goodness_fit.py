1-SAMPLE T-TEST
Examine whether a new teaching method affects the average test scores of students.
We hypothesize that the new teaching method has not changed the average test score
from the traditional method, which is known to be 75.

One-Sample t-Test for Average Test Scores
Formulating Hypotheses
•  Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean test score with the new teaching method is equal to 75.
H0 : μ <= 75
•  Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean test score with the new teaching method is different from 75.
H1 : μ > 75

2-SAMPLE T-TEST ==> Independent 
H0 : There is no significant change between the 2 methods  
There is no significant difference between the two teaching methods
H1 : There is significant change between the 2 methods and method 2 is better
There is a significant difference between the two teaching methods.
