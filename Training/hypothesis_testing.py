'''
1-SAMPLE T-TEST
Formulating Hypotheses:
•  H0 : μ = 300
•  H1 : μ ≠ 300
The t-test checks whether the sample mean is significantly
different from the population mean.
Since the sample mean is very close to 300, the p-value will be higher,
indicating insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis
at the 0.05 significance level.
